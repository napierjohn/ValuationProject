## Description

This website is on its way to become a personal tool of mine to do research on real estate property. Though now it is more of a resource document, the end goal is to create more complex financial analyis tools and the ability to scrape Louisville's Commishioner's Sales site and pull deeds from Jeff Co Reg. of Deeds.  

## Project Build

This site was also built to test my HTML,CSS, and JS skills gained from Code Louisville and Treehouse.  I first built the home page by hand then built the JeffCoTools.html + .css using the Bootstrap framework.

The homepage code was either typed in or pasted snippets adjusted to work for my page.  I wanted to determine everything myself, make it responsive, and expereince all the obstacles one might find when making their first webpage.  Infact, I wanted that experience because this would be my only first webpage.  This page uses Normalize.css.

The JeffCoTools page and associated files were made with Bootstrap.  My **goal** was to **mimic** the homepage in all styles and each componant (tabs, responsive actions, hero background, navigation sequence, etc) of the top and bottom of the page - not the center content.  this page reles on Bootstrap for the Normaize.css features.

## Custom CSS Classes

I made many custom classes but below are a few:
The class(es) I created are:

1. Index.html and Hopempage.css

```CSS
    .navList {}
        /* Class containing code for a CSS navigation bar from tablet and larger screens.
        For a tablet, the navigation display is block but changes to inline-block.
        The size, fonts, and such change to look good in larger screens.
        */
    .tab {}
        /* Class that directs the changes of the tabbed Multi-family Trulia properties.  
        */
    .dropdown-content{}
        /*Class that controls the navigation dropdown menu in the smallest of screens.
        CSS based dropdown snippet I adjusted for my use.
        */
```

2. JeffCoTools.html and css

```CSS
    .banner {}
        /* Container for banner at top.  Banner is responsive and verbage and fonts change
        to accomodate screen size.
        */
    .navbar {}
        /* Bootstrap code for navigation.  I added other features to include icons, dropdown
        styling/method, and other responsive features.
        */
```

## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

1. Index.html and Hopempage.css

```javascript
    /*
    */
```

2. JeffCoTools.html and css

```javascript
    /*
    */
```
